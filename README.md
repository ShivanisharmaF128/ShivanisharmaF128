Hi, I'm Shivani Sharma! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my MCA in AI & ML at Amity University,
with a strong passion for data science. 
I'm dedicated to honing my skills in this field
and working on various projects to deepen my knowledge
and expertise.

Beyond the technical realm,
I have a love for poetry and story writing.

Feel free to reach out to me at ShivanisharmaF128
